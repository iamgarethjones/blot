# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I am Gareth Jones.

I'm a sustainability manager based in the UK who helps businesses improve their environmental and social impacts.

This is my place on the internet where I share simple ideas on how to be more environmentally and socially responsible along with my thoughts on purposeful, sustainable and happy living.

When I'm not trying to make the world a better place at work I enjoy cooking, baking, watching films and spending time with my family.
