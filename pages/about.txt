# About Me

Sustainability is something that I have been passionate about since completing a masters in environmental impact assessment, management systems and auditing in 2006. Since then I've worked on some fantastic projects across Europe which have helped businesses adopt more sustainable ways of doing things.

I want to highlight some of the ways businesses can be kinder to the environment, employees and communities which go beyond the standard definition of "sustainability".

Everything we do has an impact from the things we buy to the products and services we sell. I aim to help businesses and organisations make better and more informed choices which will reduce negative environmental and social impacts and create some positive ones.
