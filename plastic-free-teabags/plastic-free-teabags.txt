# Are You Using Plastic-free Teabags?

Ever since the BBC broadcast *Blue Planet 2* there has been a growing movement to ban single-use plastics which are contributing to pollution on land and at sea which is a hazard to wildlife. As such many people and businesses are taking steps to reduce the amount of plastic in their products.

One such product that contains plastic, believe it or not, are teabags which use plastic to seal the bag. Unfortunately this plastic is likely to end up in the natural environment if these teabags are thrown away or even put in a green waste or compost bin. This includes teabags from big brands such as Tetley and Typhoo.

However, many tea manufacturers are now making the switch from sealant using polypropylene, a plastic made from oil, to polylactic acid (PLA) which is often made from cornstarch. PLA is much less damaging to the environment, is completely biodegradable, and can be put in green waste bins unlike other types of teabag. It’s worth noting that some PLA is made from genetically-modified (GM) sources.

## Isn’t PLA a Plastic???

It’s perhaps a little confusing that PLA is often referred to as a “bio-plastic” but teabags containing PLA are often labelled as “plastic-free” which seems a bit contradictory. As a result some brands have scrapped using the phrase “plastic-free” and are calling them “plant-based” teabags.

## Biodegradable Isn’t the Same as Compostable

Speaking about confusing terms... teabags are often referred to as biodegradable or compostable which on the surface sound like the same thing but are actually different.

**Biodegradable** teabags can be broken down through a process that often requires a lot of heat such as those used by local authorities and commercial waste collectors. Therefore they won’t necessarily breakdown if you put them in your own composting bin.

**Compostable** teabags should naturally decompose in your own compost bin. Teabags containing PLA often can’t be composted but can be collected in green waste bins for offsite treatment where they will fully decompose.

## Who Provide Plant-based, Biodegradable, Teabags in Britain?

*Note: I believe this information to be accurate at the time of publishing but it may have since changed. Check the packaging and conduct your own research when choosing a tea brand.*

There’s a growing number of brands which are offering plant-based teabags which includes some own-brands and some ranges from the likes of the Co-op, Lidl and Waitrose. However please check the packaging to see which products offer this. Some manufacturers communicate much more about the sustainability of their products making it easier to make more informed choices. This includes:

**Clipper** offer fully biodegradable plant-based teabags which are also unbleached meaning that they are even more sustainable. What’s more, a lot of their tea is Fairtrade certified.

**Pukka** teabags contain no plastic and are made using a simple stitch of organic cotton and a unique folding process.

**Tea Pigs** were the first tea company to be awarded the Plastic-Free Trust Mark as their tea bags have always been made from cornstarch meaning that they are biodegradable. The inner plastic wrapper that keeps the tea fresh has also been replaced by Natureflex which is made from wood pulp and is 100% compostable.

Of the larger tea brands, some like Tetley and Typhoo continue to offer teabags with PLA but some are making the switch.

**PG Tips**, for example, use paper teabags that have been sealed with polypropylene but are in the process of moving over to using a plant-based material derived from corn which eliminates this plastic and means that their teabags will be biodegradable. Plastic isn’t just found in the teabag but is also found in the packaging and PG Tips is going a step further than some by introducing ‘naked’ boxes which are plastic-free.

**Yorkshire Tea** use natural fibres in their tea bag and are also phasing out the use of plastic in their teabags moving over to PLA from cornstarch. Like PG Tips, Yorkshire Tea are also looking to phase out the use of plastic packaging from around their boxes and they expect this to happen in 2021.

**Twinings** made the switch to completely biodegradable material for their traditional teabags in January 2020 and plan to switch all their ranges over within the first half of 2021. They are currently trying to source an even better material which means that their teabags can be self-composted rather than rely on food waste kerbside collections.

## A Note About Other Impacts

It’s important to note that teabags also have a wider environmental and social impact than the material in the teabag. For example, you might want to consider whether the packaging contains plastic or whether the tea has been sustainably and ethically sourced and carries a Fairtrade, or similar, accreditation.

It would be remiss of me not to mention that one way to avoid teabags containing plastic is to use loose-leaf tea. However, this is unlikely to be a viable solution for most business environments.

## In Summary

Some teabags contain plastic which are used to seal the bags. When these bags are thrown away or composted this plastic pollutes the environment. Some manufacturers have switched to a plant-based alternative for the plastic making them environmentally-friendly. However you should check whether they can be composted at home or if they need to be put in a kerbside collection to ensure they fully biodegrade.

If your business provides teabags to employees or guests consider switching to a 100% biodegradable bag such as those offered by Clipper, Pukka or Tea Pigs. Also try to buy teabags that carry an ethically-sourced label and that have recyclable packaging.
